# üì£ NOTICE
I'm aware of an issue with Play Protect. This is marking my app as milicious when it isn't (you have the source code).
This is because the app is not in the Whitelist of Play Protect. I've already sent a form for fixing this to Google
 
Thanks for you comprehension.

## üìñCredits

[xManager](https://github.com/xManager-v2) for it's incredible API.

Thanks to [Seal](https://github.com/JunkFood02/Seal) and [JunkFood02](https://github.com/JunkFood02) for some of the code of the app and UI ideas. (Without you, this app would not have existed). I learnt a lot about architectures, corroutines, Jetpack Compose...

[Philipp Lackner](https://www.youtube.com/c/PhilippLackner). Infinite thanks to you, Philipp. You made me learn infite things with just a few videos. This guys explains literally everything about what is he coding, make apps just to make the community learn and give us some amazing utilities. Without he, probably i wouldn't started to code for Android. 

[Material color utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) for having Material You coloring in any device (not automatic).

KatokaChan, for the app name. (Thank you!)
