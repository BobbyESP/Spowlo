## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
The Spotify mods downloader has been deleted by request of the xManager team. This is because having the mod downloader in Spowlo meant an avoid of their ads/earning methods. xManager has to pay servers and they pay those just for making the users have free Spotify, I hope that you all understand.

## üîÆ Features

- Download songs from Spotify thanks to the [spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader/) library.

- Downloading without links, just a search query 

- Download full playlists with just one click.

- Embed synced lyrics into the downloaded songs.

- Easy to use and user-friendly.

- [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) style UI, with dynamic color theme.

- MAD: UI and logic written purely on Kotlin. It's used just an activity and composable destinations and deep links thanks to the navigation library.

## ‚¨áÔ∏èDownload

For most devices, it is recommended to install the **ARM64-v8a** version of the apks

- Download the latest stable version from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/BobbyESP/Spowlo/releases/latest)

Thanks to [Seal](https://github.com/JunkFood02/Seal) and [JunkFood02](https://github.com/JunkFood02) for some of the code of the app and UI ideas. (Without you, this app would not have existed). I learnt a lot about architectures, corroutines, Jetpack Compose...
